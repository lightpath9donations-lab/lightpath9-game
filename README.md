# ðŸŒŸ Light Seeker â€“ The Path of Giving

A minimal spiritual web game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This static single-page game includes four scenes: Village, Marketplace, Temple, and Light. The final scene shows a UPI QR and a copy-to-clipboard UPI ID.

Before publishing:
1. Replace the placeholder UPI ID in index.html (input#upiId value) with your real UPI ID.
2. If you want feedback emailed directly, set EmailJS IDs in script.js.

How to publish (quick):
1. git init; git add .; git commit -m "Initial commit â€” Light Seeker"
2. gh repo create lightpath9-game --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
3. In GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Pages, set Source to main branch / root and Save.

Enjoy!
